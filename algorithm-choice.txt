UCB-V (variance-aware UCB). Rewards are stationary, bounded, and heteroscedastic (Uniform×Binomial × Uniform), so accounting for per-arm variance improves confidence bounds and sample efficiency. In seed-0 probing, arms differ in both mean and spread; UCB-V explicitly adjusts for this.
Rejected: ε-greedy (simple but wastes pulls with fixed/slowly decaying exploration), UCB1 (good baseline but assumes common variance and can be too optimistic under heteroscedastic rewards), Thompson Sampling with Gaussian/Beta models (strong in practice but introduces model-mismatch and tuning overhead not needed here).
